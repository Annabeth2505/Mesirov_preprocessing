# Repo Overview 
This repository contains my solutions to the GenePattern Data Preprocessing Assignment shared with me by the Mesirov Lab. The goal is to answer some standard pre-processing questions which include:

* reading and parssing GenePattern datasets (.gct files)
* computing descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) across samples
* visualizing gene expression and frequency through histograms
* applying filtering techniques to retrieve specific parts of the database
* comparing distributions before and after


# Datasets 
This assignment makes use of two gene expression datasets, both of the .gct file type. The datasets are mentioned as follows:    

* Smaller minimal Dataset (included in the repo)    
  https://datasets.genepattern.org/data/test_data/BRCA_minimal_60x19.gct     
  Small dataset for quick function validation. 
* Larger Dataset (not included but linked below)
  https://datasets.genepattern.org/data/test_data/BRCA_large_20783x40.gct       
  Larger test data for analysis.       


# Requirements
Note: This assignment was developed in the GenePattern Notebook environment which provides its own managed Python kernel. 
* Python 3.9+ (if reproducing outside of the GenePattern Notebook environment)
* Libraries:
    - Pandas
    - Matplotlib
    - Seaborn
